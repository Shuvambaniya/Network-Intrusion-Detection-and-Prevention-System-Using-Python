# Network-Intrusion-Detection-and-Prevention-System-Using-Python
With the rapid advancement of technology and the increasing dependence on the internet, cybersecurity has become a major concern for organizations and individuals alike. Cybercriminals are continuously developing sophisticated attack methods, making traditional security solutions ineffective in detecting and mitigating modern cyber threats. This has led to the development of Network Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (NIDPS)â€”advanced security solutions designed to monitor, detect, and prevent malicious activities within a network The Advanced Network Intrusion Detection System (IDS) implemented in this project is a real-time network monitoring tool that analyzes network traffic, detects potential threats, and takes proactive actions to prevent security breaches. The system utilizes a graphical user interface (GUI) built with Tkinter, enabling users to monitor and manage network security easily. The IDS supports packet sniffing, anomaly detection, firewall-based IP blocking, logging, and reporting, making it a comprehensive security solution.

A Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) is a cybersecurity tool designed to monitor network traffic for suspicious activities and security violations. It operates by capturing packets and analyzing their characteristics to detect malware, unauthorized access, denial-of-service attacks, and data exfiltration. However, traditional IDSs only alert security administrators when an intrusion is detected but do not take immediate action to stop the attack. To address this limitation, a Network Intrusion Prevention System (NIPS) extends IDS functionality by automatically blocking or mitigating detected threats. A Network Intrusion Detection and Prevention System (NIDPS) combines both IDS and IPS functionalities, providing a proactive and automated security solution.The motivation behind implementing this Advanced Network IDS is to provide a real-time, automated, and intelligentsecurity system that can detect and respond to cyber threats effectively. Traditional security systems rely on manual intervention, which may lead to delayed responses and higher risks. By integrating machine learning techniques, automated response mechanisms, and real-time monitoring, this project aims to create a robust and scalable security framework.
